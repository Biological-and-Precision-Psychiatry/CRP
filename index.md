# CRP - An R-package from the Copenhagen Research Centre for Biological and Precision Psychiatry

**CRP** is not only an abbreviation of *Copenhagen Research Centre for
Biological and Precision Psychiatry*, it is also and abbrevation of
[C-reactive protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein)
which is the perhaps most important blood
[biomarker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker) of acute systemic
[inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation). Such
biomarkers are at the heart of the research we do at the Copenhagen
Research Centre for Biological and Precision Psychiatry.
