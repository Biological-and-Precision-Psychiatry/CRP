quick_read_excel(
  path,
  sheet = NULL,
  range = NULL,
  col_names = TRUE,
  col_types = NULL,
  na = "",
  trim_ws = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the xls/xlsx file.}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to read. Either a string (the name of a sheet), or an
integer (the position of the sheet). Ignored if the sheet is specified via
\code{range}. If neither argument specifies the sheet, defaults to the first
sheet.}

\item{range}{A cell range to read from, as described in \link[readxl]{cell-specification}.
Includes typical Excel ranges like "B3:D87", possibly including the sheet
name like "Budget!B2:G14", and more. Interpreted strictly, even if the
range forces the inclusion of leading or trailing empty rows or columns.
Takes precedence over \code{skip}, \code{n_max} and \code{sheet}.}

\item{col_names}{\code{TRUE} to use the first row as column names, \code{FALSE} to get
default names, or a character vector giving a name for each column. If user
provides \code{col_types} as a vector, \code{col_names} can have one entry per
column, i.e. have the same length as \code{col_types}, or one entry per
unskipped column.}

\item{col_types}{Either \code{NULL} to guess all from the spreadsheet or a
character vector containing one entry per column from these options:
"skip", "guess", "logical", "numeric", "date", "text" or "list". If exactly
one \code{col_type} is specified, it will be recycled. The content of a cell in
a skipped column is never read and that column will not appear in the data
frame output. A list cell loads a column as a list of length 1 vectors,
which are typed using the type guessing logic from \code{col_types = NULL}, but
on a cell-by-cell basis.}

\item{na}{Character vector of strings to interpret as missing values. By
default, readxl treats blank cells as missing data.}

\item{trim_ws}{Should leading and trailing whitespace be trimmed?}

\item{skip}{Minimum number of rows to skip before reading anything, be it
column names or data. Leading empty rows are automatically skipped, so this
is a lower bound. Ignored if \code{range} is given.}

\item{n_max}{Maximum number of data rows to read. Trailing empty rows are
automatically skipped, so this is an upper bound on the number of rows in
the returned tibble. Ignored if \code{range} is given.}

\item{guess_max}{Maximum number of data rows to use for guessing column
types.}

\item{progress}{Display a progress spinner? By default, the spinner appears
only in an interactive session, outside the context of knitting a document,
and when the call is likely to run for several seconds or more. See
\code{\link[readxl:readxl_progress]{readxl_progress()}} for more details.}

\item{.name_repair}{Handling of column names. Passed along to
\code{\link[tibble:as_tibble]{tibble::as_tibble()}}. readxl's default is `.name_repair = "unique", which
ensures column names are not empty and are unique.}
}
\value{
A tibble
}
\description{
\code{readxl::read_excel} is very slow when reading excel files from network
drives. This function fixes that by copying the file to a temporary file that
exists on a local drive which is then quickly read using \code{readxl::read_excel}.
}
\details{
The temporary file is made using \code{base::tempfile} and deleted using
\code{base::unlink} and \code{base::on.exit} when exiting from \code{quick_read_excel}.

All arguments are taken verbatim from \code{readxl::read_excel}.

# Reading an xls-file:
path_to_file <- system.file("extdata", "clippy.xls", package = "readxl", 
                            mustWork = TRUE)
quick_read_excel(path_to_file)

# Reading an xlsx-file:
path_to_file <- system.file("extdata", "clippy.xlsx", package = "readxl", 
                            mustWork = TRUE)
quick_read_excel(path_to_file)
