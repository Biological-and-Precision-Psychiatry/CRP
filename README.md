# CRP - An R-package from the Copenhagen Research Centre for Biological and Precision Psychiatry 
**CRP** is not only an abbreviation of _Copenhagen Research Centre for Biological and Precision Psychiatry_, it is also and abbrevation of [C-reactive protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein) which is the perhaps most important blood [biomarker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker) of acute systemic [inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation). Such biomarkers are at the heart of the research we do at the Copenhagen Research Centre for Biological and Precision Psychiatry.
